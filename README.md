# Level Editor

Author collaborative orthogonal tile maps with layers, typed properties, stamps, painting tools and personal undo.

## Install

Requires a running [Ink OS](https://github.com/siliconjungle/ink-os-platform) instance and its `ink-os` CLI. Use Node.js 24 or later for development.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/siliconjungle/ink-app-level-editor.git
cd ink-app-level-editor
npm test
# Select your Ink instance using its CLI connection profile.
ink-os deploy .
```

The CLI deploys committed source from your checkout. Commit any edits before deploying them. No credentials or personal instance configuration belong in this repository.

## Behaviour and limits

Export editable Ink map JSON or a ZIP with Tiled JSON and source images. Layer locks are editing controls; instance account permissions govern access.

## Development

`npm run dev` opens a local development server. Preview fixtures are separate from live Ink data.

## License

MIT for app code. Bundled third-party components retain their own licenses and notices.
